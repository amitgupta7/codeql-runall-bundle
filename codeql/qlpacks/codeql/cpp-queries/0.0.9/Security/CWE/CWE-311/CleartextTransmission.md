# Cleartext transmission of sensitive information
Sensitive information that is stored unencrypted is accessible to an attacker who gains access to the storage.


## Recommendation
Ensure that sensitive information is always encrypted before being stored to a file or transmitted over the network. It may be wise to encrypt information before it is put into a buffer that may be readable in memory.

In general, decrypt sensitive information only at the point where it is necessary for it to be used in cleartext.


## Example
The following example shows two ways of storing user credentials in a file. In the 'BAD' case, the credentials are simply stored in cleartext. In the 'GOOD' case, the credentials are encrypted before storing them.


```c
void writeCredentials() {
  char *password = "cleartext password";
  FILE* file = fopen("credentials.txt", "w");
  
  // BAD: write password to disk in cleartext
  fputs(password, file);
  
  // GOOD: encrypt password first
  char *encrypted = encrypt(password);
  fputs(encrypted, file);
}


```
