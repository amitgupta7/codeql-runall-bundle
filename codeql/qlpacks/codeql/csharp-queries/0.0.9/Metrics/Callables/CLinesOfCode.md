# Lines of code per method
This metric measures the number of lines of code each method has. If methods have too many lines they may be difficult to understand and hence a source of defects. It is also an indication that methods may be trying to do too much.


## Recommendation
Extract logical parts of long methods into auxiliary methods. As a guideline, each method should be able to be read on screen without scrolling.
