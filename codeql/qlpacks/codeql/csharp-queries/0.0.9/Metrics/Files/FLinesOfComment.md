# Lines of comments in files
This metric measures the (absolute) number of comment lines per file. Whilst this is not especially meaningful out of context a low number of comments may indicate files that are difficult to understand due to poor documentation.


## Recommendation
Consider if the file needs more documentation. Short files might not but most files should have at least a comment explaining their purpose.
