# Number of interfaces
This metric measures the number of interfaces in each file. Interfaces are public facing by design and as such any changes to them will have a large impact. This impact can be reduced by compartmentalizing each interface into its own source file.


## Recommendation
Give all interfaces their own dedicated file.
