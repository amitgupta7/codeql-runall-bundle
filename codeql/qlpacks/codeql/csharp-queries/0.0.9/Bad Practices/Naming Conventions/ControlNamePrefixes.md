# ASP.NET control name prefixes
It is good practice to prefix the names of ASP.NET web controls with a shortened version of their type. This makes the controls easier to find in Intellisense and also makes the purpose of the control more clear.


## Recommendation
Give controls an appropriate prefix to indicate their type (for example, `txt` for text boxes or `rad` for radio buttons).
