# Encryption using ECB
ECB should not be used as a mode for encryption. It has dangerous weaknesses. Data is encrypted the same way every time meaning the same plaintext input will always produce the same cyphertext. This makes encrypted messages vulnerable to replay attacks.


## Recommendation
Use a different CypherMode.
