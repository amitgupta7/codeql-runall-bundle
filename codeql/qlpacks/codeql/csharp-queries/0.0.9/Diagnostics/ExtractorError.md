# Extraction error
This is an internal query that finds all errors reported by the C\# extractor. It excludes results from files containing compilation errors, because these errors are likely to be caused by the compilation error rather than due to an internal error in the extractor.

Extractor errors can lead to inaccurate results.


## Recommendation
Report extractor errors to Semmle.
