# Nested loops with same variable
The behavior of nested loops in which the iteration variable is the same for both loops is difficult to understand because the inner loop affects the iteration variable of the outer loop. This is probably a typographical error.


## Recommendation
Ensure that a different iteration variable is used for each loop.
