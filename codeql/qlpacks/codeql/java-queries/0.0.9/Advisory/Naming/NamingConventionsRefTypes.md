# Misnamed class or interface
A class or interface name that begins with a lowercase letter does not follow standard naming conventions, which decreases code readability. For example, `hotelbooking`.


## Recommendation
Begin the class name with an uppercase letter and use camel case: capitalize the first letter of each word within the class name. For example, `HotelBooking`.
