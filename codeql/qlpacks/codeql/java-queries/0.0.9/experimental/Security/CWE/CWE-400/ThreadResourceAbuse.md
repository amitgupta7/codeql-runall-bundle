# Uncontrolled thread resource consumption
The `Thread.sleep` method is used to pause the execution of current thread for specified time. When the sleep time is user-controlled, especially in the web application context, it can be abused to cause all of a server's threads to sleep, leading to denial of service.


## Recommendation
To guard against this attack, consider specifying an upper range of allowed sleep time or adopting the producer/consumer design pattern with `Object.wait` method to avoid performance problems or even resource exhaustion. For more information, refer to the concurrency tutorial of Oracle listed below or `java/ql/src/Likely Bugs/Concurrency` queries of CodeQL.


## Example
The following example shows a bad situation and a good situation respectively. In the bad situation, a thread sleep time comes directly from user input. In the good situation, an upper range check on the maximum sleep time allowed is enforced.


```java
class SleepTest {
	public void test(int userSuppliedWaitTime) throws Exception {
		// BAD: no boundary check on wait time
		Thread.sleep(userSuppliedWaitTime);

		// GOOD: enforce an upper limit on wait time
		if (userSuppliedWaitTime > 0 && userSuppliedWaitTime < 5000) {
			Thread.sleep(userSuppliedWaitTime);
		}
	}
}

```
