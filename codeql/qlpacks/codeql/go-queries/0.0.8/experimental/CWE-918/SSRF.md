# Uncontrolled data used in network request
Directly incorporating user input into an HTTP request without validating the input can facilitate server side request forgery attacks, where the attacker controls the request target.


## Recommendation
To guard against server side request forgery, it is advisable to avoid putting user input directly into a network request. If using user input is necessary, then it must be validated. It is recommended to only allow user input consisting of alphanumeric characters. Simply URL-encoding other chracters is not always a solution, for example because a downstream entity that is itself vulnerable may decode again before forwarding the request.


## Example
The following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a URL request without validating the input, which facilitates an SSRF attack. The request `http.Get("https://example.com/current_api/"+target)` is vulnerable since attackers can choose the value of `target` to be anything they want. For instance, the attacker can choose `"../super_secret_api"` as the target, causing the URL to become `"https://example.com/super_secret_api"`.

A request to `https://example.com/super_secret_api` may be problematic if that api is not meant to be directly accessible from the attacker's machine.


```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	target := req.FormValue("target")

	// BAD: `target` is controlled by the attacker
	resp, err := http.Get("https://example.com/current_api/" + target)
	if err != nil {
		// error handling
	}

	// process request response
	use(resp)
}

```
One way to remedy the problem is to validate the user input to only allow alphanumeric values:


```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/go-playground/validator"
	"net/http"
)

func goodHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	validate := validator.New()
	target := req.FormValue("target")
	if validate.Var(target, "alphanum") == nil {
		// GOOD: `target` is alphanumeric
		resp, err := http.Get("https://example.com/current_api/" + target)
		if err != nil {
			// error handling
		}
		// process request response
		use(resp)
	}
}

```
